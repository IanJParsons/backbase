Backbase Assignment

---------------------------------
Please find the expected files for the assignment available in the repository. 

1. The ComputerDatabaseManualTests excel document contains 2 tabs, the first containing written test scripts, the second containing one-liner test conditions for further scenarios/edge cases.
2. The Computer Database Test Approach Word document contains notes on test design approach and scope, along with additional considerations
3. The BackBase zip folder contains the Selenium Webdriver script created along with all with the version of geckodriver used. 

As you may recall from my intial telephone interview I have almost no auotmation experience, but I have tried to produce a script using Java that opens the site, identifies and then clicks the Add a new computer button and then verifies that the correct URL has been opened as a result. I'm afraid that's all I have been able to do to date given the time constraints and my level of knowledge and ability. There is a lot more that I could conceive could be done (such separating into individual reporting test cases that can be run as a suite) and there are probably more elegant ways of doing the few basic functins I have, if I had the know how to do so.
